<h2>Documentation</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><b>Corona: Realm of Magic</b> is a rogue-like computer
role-playing game.

<p>It serves as a platform on which the author can air his
opinions about rogue-like games.

<p>Many games throughout history have inspired and otherwise
fed into <b>Corona</b>:	the "old-school" games like Wumpus,
Colossal Cave[/Adventure], and Dungeon[/Zork]; the classic
roguelikes like Rogue itself, [Net]Hack, Moria[/Angband], as
well as more recent roguelikes like AlphaMan, ZZT[/Megazeux]
and ADOM; commercial CRPG's have some influence on it as
well, from earlier game series like Ultima, Bard's Tale, and
Pool of Radiance, to more recent ones like Final Fantasy,
Dungeon Master [Amiga], and Diablo.

<p>Corona is built on the <a href="../../doc/index.html">CARPE DIEM</a> game engine.
(In fact CARPE DIEM evolved out of the original Corona.)

<h3>Game Overview</h3>

<p>You command a band (or bands) of adventurers who set out to find
fame, fortune, riches, experience, and excitement in a relatively
open-ended fashion.

<h3>The World</h3>

<p><b>Corona: Realm of Magoc</b> is set in a large fantasy universe, primarily on a newly-
colonized and largely-unexplored continent where magic forces
abound and various groups vy for power.

<p>Civilization has barely yet gotten a foothold on this world that
the explorers call Aelia, the new world, and the residents call
Q'lob Stehlm, their ancestral homeland.

<p>The larger settlements, like Bakersport and Saiphan, have become
walled cities, keeping the noblemen and women safe from the
rampaging hordes of grotesques and spririts, but leaving the
farmers and peasants in the surrounding countryside without support;
only their savvy and pioneer spirit remain to help protect them.

<p>Meanwhile the nomadic native creatures are adapting to this
intrusion, forming camps and strongholds of their own, as their
far-superior knowledge of the countryside allows them to conceal
their machinations extremely effectively.

<h3>Ability Stats</h3>

<p>All creatures, monsters and characters alike, have important
attributes which are generated randomly upon their creation.
These attributes are called <i>ability stats</i> and are chosen
for human beings as the sum of three six-sided dice rolls (rolls
for other beings are usually based on this as well, with certain
tradeoffs.)

<p>Each creature has a maximum value for each stat, as well as
an operating value.  An operating value lower than a maximum
value indicates that the creature has sustained some manner of
injury, be it physical, mental, or spiritual.  When allowed to
rest, operating stats will tend to heal back towards (but not
beyond) the maximum stat.  Operating stats can also be boosted
above the maximum stat temporarily; they will fall back to the
maximum stat in time.

<p>The stats are:

<ul>
<p><li>STRENGTH.  A measure of the raw muscular strength of the
creature.  Extreme pain and weakening agents such as poisons
subtract from operating strength.  An operating strength of
zero indicates a creature is too weak to move.  A negative
operating strength will kill a creature by means of
complete muscular atrophy.

<p><li>CONSTITUTION.  A measure of the physical makeup and
endurance of the creature.  Physical damage subtracts from
operating constitution.  An operating constitution of
zero indicates a creature is too wounded to move.  A negative
operating constitution will kill a creature by means of fatal
wounding.

<p><li>DEXTERITY.  A measure of the agility and overall
swiftness of the creature.  Constriction and cold attacks
subtract from operating dexterity.  An operating dexterity of
zero indicates a creature is too constricted or frozen
to move.  A negative operating dexterity will kill a
creature by means of strangulation or crushing.

<p><li>INTELLIGENCE.  A measure of the overall reasoning
capabilities of the creature.  Psychic attacks and critical
head hits subtract from operating intelligence.  An
operating intelligence of zero indicates a creature is too
senseless or brain-damaged to move.  A negative operating
intelligence will kill a creature by means of brain death.

<p><li>SPIRIT.  A measure of the overall spiritual
balance of the creature, also related to the awareness,
alacrity, and ego of the creature in general.  Casting
commonplace magical spells subtract from operating spirit.  An
operating spirit of zero indicates a creature is too
exhausted or depressed to move.  A negative operating
spirit may subtract from the creature's maximum constitution.

<p><li>CHARISMA.  A measure of the likeableness and natural
ease with the creature interacts with others, also related to
the cunning of the creature.  Peer/community pressure, disfiguring
(acid) attacks, and acquiring unpleasant scents subtract from operating charisma.  An
operating charisma of zero indicates a creature is too bitter and
twisted to do anything except inspire fear and loathing on sight.
A negative operating charisma cannot be achieved.

</ul>

<h3>Combat System</h3>

<h4>Melee Weapons</h4>

<p>A character may only engage in melee with a weapon in their dominant
hand unless they have a talent at two-handed combat.  Ambidextrous
characters may change what their dominant hand is at any time by
switching stance.  Without a weapon readied in the dominant hand, a
creature will use its body weaponry (which in the case of humanoids
consists by default of a single punch.)

<p>A weapon has one or more attacks.  For each attack several values
are associated: the accuracy of the attack (bonus modifier added to
the to-hit roll,) the potental damage (as dice with a bonus modifier,)
and the makeup of the damaging blow in terms of elements, for
determining scaled damage based on resistance.

<p>In addition, the item itself is made of up elements.  These elements
determine (upon object creation) various properties of the weapon
itself.  These properties include color, density (scale of weight),
and hardness (implemented as resistances on the item itself.)

<p>A reflexive talent of weapon proficiency may be acquired and improved
for each class of weapon (sword, quarterstaff, and so forth.)  A
successful use of this talent effectively gives the character a second
to-hit roll.

<h4>Armour</h4>

<p>Armour, which includes clothing, are items which can be wielded on
places other the hands.

<p>Each piece of armour has a coverage value, which is the percent of
the region it is worn on that it protects.
It also has a condition value which describes how damaged it is.

<p>In addition, the item itself is made of up elements.  These elements
determine (upon object creation) various properties of the armour
itself.  These properties include color, density (scale of weight),
and hardness (implemented as resistances on the item itself.)

<p>Initial condition (durability) is derived from weight (base weight
times density.)  Each strike of weapon on armour damages both the
weapon and the armour.  Each is subject to resistance from the other
based on the elements in play.

<p>A reflexive talent of armour use may be acquired and improved.
for each class of weapon (sword, quarterstaff, and so forth.)  A
successful use of this talent effectively lets the roll on
coverage to be taken again.

<h3>Guilds</h3>

<p>The residents of Aelia are no strangers to the idea of the division
of labour.  Many organizations, both religious and secular in nature,
attract many adventurers who rise up their ranks in their pursuit of
fame, power, and riches.  These guilds provide training and standing
for their members, for a fee.

<p>Training involves both physical and personal development, as well
as acquiring and improving talents.

<p>With respect to personal training, each guild is associated with
an ability stat called the prime desired stat.  Some guilds also
have another ability stat called the secondary desired stat.
As a character climbs the ranks of a guild, at a rate determined
by the guild, they are offered the opportunity to permanently
enhance these ability stats.

<p>With respect to learning talents, each guild protects a set of
skills which it grants to its members as they rise in rank.
While the use of these talents is not restricted to guild members,
some are protected by the guild, such that the costs or chances of
non-members acquiring them are prohibitive.  Each talent is only
available at a certain guild rank and above.  Once acquired, the
talent may also be improved in lieu of learning a new talent (if one
is available.)

<h4>The Basic Six Adventurer Guilds</h4>

<ul>
<p><li>
SOLDIER.  Warriors who are used to looking at the world from behind
the haft of a drawn blade.  It's not a pleasant or easy job but there's
rarely a problem finding work.

<p>The prime desired stat of the soldier is strength.  Soldier talents
include combat theory, assorted physical conditioning skills,
weapon and armour familiarity, assorted combat manouevers, and some
defense and survival techniques.

<p><li>RANGER.  Patrolmen who are relied upon to scout and explore the
wilderness, often on horseback.  Esteemed for upholding the "tough
cookie" image through thick and thin.

<p>The prime desired stat of the ranger is constitution.  Ranger talents
include wilderness survival, identifying flora and fauna, hunting
and fishing, trapping and skinning, as well as archery and horseback
riding.

<p><li>THIEF.  Dodgy, nervous individuals who like to think of themselves
as simply pursuing alternative strategies to making a living.

<p>The prime desired stat of the thief is dexterity.  Thief talents
include picking pockets, picking locks, detecting and disarming traps,
moving around unseen and unheard, and surprising unwary creatures.

<p><li>MAGE.  A student and scientist of magic who seeks naught but to
unlock the unseen forces of the universe.

<p>The prime desired stat of the mage is intelligence.  Mage talents
include magic theory plus various spells.  The mage guild protects
a rather broad, general-purpose assortment of spells, rather than
any specialization.  The spell types include attack spells, defense
spells, transmutation spells, and escape spells, with the occasional
detection spell and such thrown in for good measure.

<p><li>CLERIC.  One of those that believe themselves to be the truly devout.
Each cleric worships a diety and belongs to a religious establishment
of fellow worshippers.

<p>The prime desired stat of the cleric is spirit.  Cleric talents
include various prayers; exactly which ones depends on the diety,
but the prayers often deal in protection, divination, and healing,
as well as blessing and cursing items, people, and locations, and
turning or commanding undead beings.

<p><li>BARD.  The entertainer who considers themself an artist with a taste
for adventure; everyone loves a bard, and bards love to party.

<p>The prime desired stat of the bard is charisma.  The most notable
bard talent is playing a musical instrument, but dancing and acting
are also valuable skills, as are more academic studies like music
theory.

<p>Due to the magical nature of the world, experienced bards can impart
spell-like mind-altering effects with their music, such as causing
sensations of fellowship, enmity, fear, placidity, and drowsiness -
but these enchanted tunes cannot affect those that cannot hear them.
