<h3>About CARPE DIEM</h3>

<p>CARPE DIEM is an engine and framework for games.

<p>CARPE DIEM can be loosely described as a 'roguelike' game engine.
It is primarily keypress-controlled, but a menu-driven interface
is also employed, and players more comfortable with menus can use
them exclusively.

<p>In this context, roguelike primarily means: the area surrounding the
currently active characters is displayed as a two-dimensional
iconic map on the computer or terminal's screen.  This map may be
larger than the current screen (it will scroll as needed.)

<p>First-person perspective is not supported.

<p>You, as the player, can command an entire party of adventurers, both
those totally under your control (PC's) and those you have hired
(NPC's.)

<p>Eventually management of multiple parties will be possible, so that
a party of more than one character can split into two parties, and
two parties can join to form a bigger party.  Play may switch between
parties at any point.

<p>Only turn-based gameplay is supported, not real-time.

<p>The combat and talent systems need work, but show promise.


<h3>The Implementation</h3>

<p>CARPE DIEM is written entirely in Perl 5.x.  It uses few external
modules so there should be little need to worry about obtaining
the "right extras"; as long as you have a stable, basic configuration
of Perl installed, it should run.

<p>CARPE DIEM uses a display abstraction layer, so as long as you can
describe exactly how to render any given object (say, a dragon,)
you can, with enough work, make it display on any display device
you could possibly access via Perl.

<p>By default, however, only generic, console-or-terminal based
display drivers are selected.  Drivers are included for console
input and output under 32-bit Windows, terminal input under POSIX,
and terminal output under ANSI (or VT100); the output functionality
includes colour modules which support sixteen colours under 32-bit
Windows and ANSI, and a crude approximation on VT100 terminals
which only support an intensity bit.

<p>Curses is only used if it has already been installed as a
library for the Perl interpreter, so display refreshing is not
guaranteed to be particularly optimized, and it is recommended
CARPE DIEM be run from a console if Curses is not available.

<p>In order to coexist with ANSI keypress sequences which begin
with an escape character, the escape key must be 'double-clicked'
in order for it to register as 'escape'.

<p>This display/input abstraction layer has been tested on:

<ul>
<li>  Windows 95: console
<li>  Windows 98 SE: console
<li>  Windows NT: console
<li>  FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE: console (ANSI and Curses)
<li>  Linux 2.2.17: console, xterm (X), gsh-term (KDE)
<li>  SCO v3.x(?): console
<li>  Solaris SunOS 4: telnet
</ul>

<p>The _screen module will select what kind of character set to assume
based on the current operating system - it assumes Windows, Linux,
and FreeBSD are running on hardware with the IBM PC OEM textmode
font.  When the Mac version is done, it may use the Mac's built-in
symbolset (if not a set of dedicated graphical icons).  If a dedicated
font is one day created, that may be invoked/configured here as well.
In all other cases, generic ASCII symbols are used to represent things.
Because there are more things than symbols, some things look the same
in ASCII, and the What Is...? command can be used to identify things
on the screen.

<p>The mappings which translate keypresses into actions are configurable.
The key/ directory contains keymaps for the game Corona, and ones
resembling Hack, Rogue, Larn, ADOM, and Angband (Roguelike), and of
course it offers the possibility of rolling your own custom keymapping.
